# offline-data-syncronization

This is sample project for offline data sync with server when there is active internet connection. 

I used
* Room persistance library to store my data in offline mode. 
* JobScheduler to pass those data to server. 
* BroadcastReceiver to detect the active network.

NB. This sample project have some bug issue, soon it will be solved
